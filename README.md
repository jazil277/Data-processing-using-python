## Pima Indians Diabetes Data Analysis and Visualization Project

Project Description:

This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases. The goal is to use diagnostic measurements to predict the likelihood of diabetes in female Pima Indians, an ethnic group with a high incidence rate of the disease. The analysis includes data preparation, cleaning, visualization, and outlier detection to identify variables most strongly associated with diabetes.

Purpose of the Project:

The purpose of this project is to explore the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to identify the significant variables that predict the presence of diabetes. Using Python for data analysis and visualization, the project aims to uncover insights that can help in understanding which variables are strongly correlated with diabetes, aiding in early detection and decision-making for healthcare professionals.

Objectives:

- Data Analysis: Analyze the dataset and understand trends and patterns.

- Data Visualization: Visualize the relationship between independent variables (e.g., number of pregnancies, BMI, age, glucose levels) and the dependent variable (whether or not the patient has diabetes).

- Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers that could skew results.

- Correlation Analysis: Understand the correlation between independent variables and diabetes occurrence.

- Business Problem: Answer the key business question â€” which variables have the largest effect on the probability of a Pima Indian woman being diagnosed with diabetes?

Key Sections of the Report:

- Abstract: Introduction to data analysis and the importance of visualizing the Pima Indians dataset.

- Introduction and Background: Overview of the dataset, the problem to be solved, and its significance to global health.

- Problem Statement: Determining which variables are most strongly correlated with diabetes among Pima Indian women.

- Data Preparation: Cleaning and processing the dataset, including handling missing values and detecting outliers.

- Data Visualization: Use of scatterplots, histograms, pie charts, and regression outputs to visualize the relationships between variables and diabetes.

- Discussion and Conclusion: Key findings, including how high glucose levels, BMI, pregnancies, and age are strongly correlated with diabetes diagnosis.

Dataset:

Dependent Variable: Diabetes outcome (1 if the patient has diabetes, 0 if not).

Independent Variables: Number of pregnancies, plasma glucose levels, diastolic blood pressure, skin fold thickness, serum insulin, BMI, age, etc.

Tools Used:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Scikit-learn

How to Run the Project:

1. Clone the repository.

2. Install the required libraries via requirements.txt.

3. Load the dataset and run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

4. Explore the visualizations to understand the relationship between variables and diabetes.

Key Takeaways:

Glucose levels, BMI, and number of pregnancies are the strongest predictors of diabetes.

Outlier handling and data cleaning significantly improve the dataset's reliability.

Visualization techniques (e.g., scatterplots, histograms) help in better understanding of how different variables influence diabetes risk.
